= Description
  This is Daniel Berger's custom implementation of the original
  krb5-auth library.

= Requirements
  Kerberos 1.7.0 or later, including admin header and library files.

= Synopsis
  require 'krb5_auth'

  # Get the default realm name
  krb5 = Krb5Auth::Krb5.new
  puts krb5.default_realm
  krb5.close

  # Get the default keytab name
  keytab = Krb5Auth::Krb5::Keytab.new
  puts keytab.default_name
  keytab.close

  # Set the password for a given principal
  kadm5 = Krb5Auth::Kadm5.new(:principal => 'foo/admin', :password => 'xxxx')
  kadm5.set_password('someuser', 'abc123')
  kadm5.close

  # Using the block form
  Krb5Auth::Kadm5.new(:principal => 'foo/admin', :password => 'xxxx') do |kadm5|
    p kadm5.get_principal('someuser')
    kadm5.set_password('someuser', 'abc123')
  end

= Notes
  This fork heavily modifies the original krb5_auth library. Several new
  classes and methods have been added.

  Krb5Auth::Kadm5
  Krb5Auth::Kadm5::Config
  Krb5Auth::Krb5::Keytab
  Krb5Auth::Krb5::KeytabEntry
  Krb5Auth::Krb5::CredentialsCache
  Krb5Auth::Krb5::Principal
  Krb5Auth::Krb5::Policy

  With this fork you can create and delete principals, set and reset passwords,
  set the default realm, and read keytab entries.

  The code layout has been heavily modified as well. This fork uses separate
  source files for each class, and uses rake-compiler to glue them all
  together into a single build.

  Lastly, this fork includes many more tests.

= MIT vs Heimdal
  This code was written for the MIT Kerberos library. It has not been tested
  with the Heimdal Kerberos library.

= TODO
  Replace Struct::Principal with a Principal class with its own methods.
  Create a separate class for the replay cache.
  Better credentials cache support.
  Ability to add and delete keytab entries.

= CAVEATS
  OS X users will probably need to install Kerberos manually and specify
  the dir-config option because it ships with old Kerberos header files,
  and none of the admin headers or libraries by default.
