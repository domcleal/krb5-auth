= 0.9.0 - ???
* Refactored the Krb5Auth::Krb5 constructor so that it accepts a hash of
  options instead of merely a principal and password. The possible options
  are :principal, :password, :service, and :keytab. This change breaks
  backwards compatibility with 0.8.x.
* Added the initial underpinnings for a CredentialsCache object along with
  a preliminary set of tests. It's still in an alpha stage, so it is not
  recommended for production use at this time.

= 0.8.5 - 28-Jul-2010
* Fixed a bug where I had externs and variable declarations flip flopped
  between the source and header files, which caused builds to fail on OS X.
  Thanks go to Jeremy Hinegardner for the fix.
* Updated the test tasks to always clean first.

= 0.8.4 - 27-Jul-2010
* Refactored the source code. Several kerberos components have been split
  into their own source files.
* Added the Krb5#set_default_realm method.
* Added the Krb5#get_init_creds_keytab method.
* Added the Krb5::Keytab class plus appropriate methods.
* Added the Krb5::KeytabEntry class plus appropriate methods.
* Added the Krb5::Principal class plus appropriate methods.
* Added the Krb5::Context class plus appropriate methods.
* Added rake-compiler as a dependency.
* Added tests for new classes.

= 0.8.3 - Never released
* Modified the Kadm5.new method to handle Kerberos 1.8.0 or later, which
  had modified the function prototype for the kadm5_init_with_password()
  function.

= 0.8.2 - Never released
* Fixed a memory allocation bug in the kadm5.create_principal and
  kadm5.get_principal methods.
* Added the kadm5.close method.
* Made some error messages for the Kadm5 class more informative.
* Made the extconf.rb more strict. The kadm5clnt library mandatory or
  the build will fail.
* Added some documentation to a couple of methods where it was previously
  missing.
* Added additional tests for existing methods, including tests for error
  messages, and new tests for the kadm5.close method.

= 0.8.1 - Never released
* Added the set_password method.
* Added some additional context pointer checking to avoid potential segfaults.

= 0.8.0 - Never released
* Trimmed and altered original original code.
* Several other files changed.
* NOT FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION AT THIS TIME!
