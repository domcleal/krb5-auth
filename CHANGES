= 0.9.0 - 14-Mar-2011
* Refactored the Krb5Auth::Kadm5 constructor so that it accepts a hash of
  options instead of merely a principal and password. The possible options
  are :principal, :password, :service, and :keytab. This change breaks
  backwards compatibility with 0.8.x.
* Principal structs have been removed. Only principal classes are used now.
* The Principal.new method now requires a principal name.
* Added the Krb5Auth::Policy class which encapsulates a Kerberos policy.
* Added the Krb5Auth::CredentialsCache class which encapsulates a Kerberos
  credentials cache.
* Added the Kadm5::Config class which encapsulates Kerberos administrative
  configuration information.
* The Kadm5#create_principal method now accepts a Principal object as well.
* Added the Kadm5#find_principal method. This is similar to the get_principal
  method, but returns nil instead of raising an error if the principal cannot
  be found.
* The Kadm5#get_principal method now raises a PrincipalNotFoundException if
  the principal cannot be found in order to distinguish that failure with some
  other general failure.
* Added several more Kadm5 methods, including methods for creating, modifying,
  and deleting policies.
* Added the Principal#== method.
* Added custom .inspect methods for several classes.
* Lots of internal refactoring.
* Many more tests added, along with some refactoring.

= 0.8.5 - 28-Jul-2010
* Fixed a bug where I had externs and variable declarations flip flopped
  between the source and header files, which caused builds to fail on OS X.
  Thanks go to Jeremy Hinegardner for the fix.
* Updated the test tasks to always clean first.

= 0.8.4 - 27-Jul-2010
* Refactored the source code. Several kerberos components have been split
  into their own source files.
* Added the Krb5#set_default_realm method.
* Added the Krb5#get_init_creds_keytab method.
* Added the Krb5::Keytab class plus appropriate methods.
* Added the Krb5::KeytabEntry class plus appropriate methods.
* Added the Krb5::Principal class plus appropriate methods.
* Added the Krb5::Context class plus appropriate methods.
* Added rake-compiler as a dependency.
* Added tests for new classes.

= 0.8.3 - Never released
* Modified the Kadm5.new method to handle Kerberos 1.8.0 or later, which
  had modified the function prototype for the kadm5_init_with_password()
  function.

= 0.8.2 - Never released
* Fixed a memory allocation bug in the kadm5.create_principal and
  kadm5.get_principal methods.
* Added the kadm5.close method.
* Made some error messages for the Kadm5 class more informative.
* Made the extconf.rb more strict. The kadm5clnt library mandatory or
  the build will fail.
* Added some documentation to a couple of methods where it was previously
  missing.
* Added additional tests for existing methods, including tests for error
  messages, and new tests for the kadm5.close method.

= 0.8.1 - Never released
* Added the set_password method.
* Added some additional context pointer checking to avoid potential segfaults.

= 0.8.0 - Never released
* Trimmed and altered original original code.
* Several other files changed.
* NOT FOR GENERAL CONSUMPTION AT THIS TIME!
